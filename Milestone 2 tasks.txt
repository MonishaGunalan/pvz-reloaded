MileStone 2- Things to do
-------------------------

***********************
Milestone 1 : 4.86 / 6
***********************


write Java doc comments for all the classes, methods and variables

GUI - MVC pattern
	- create view and controller

Unit Testing
	- create test case class for each class
	- test case for every method and multiple test cases for each method where applicable
	- Black Box testing
	- Dont worry about testing I/O
	
Fix the data structure in class Level for reading from the text file.
	- create turn class(GUI needs turn class as well)
	- get rid of array of arraylist when reading the info about zombie turns from file
	- change the format of the text file to read by turn and not read by rows. 
		Eg :
		Level1
		mud
		grass
		grass
		grass
		mud
		
		turn2 (assuming no zombies spawn until turn2)
		normal 2 (zombie type, row#)
		normal 3
		turn3
		etc

Fix the errors with UML and Sequence Diagrams - Arzaan

Update Help command for user Interaction

modify the row# and col# for the seed plant method so that user is able to specify a row between 1 to 5 and not 0 to 4

update Read me file 
	- instruction of how to play the game and the commands
	- provide Git repository link
	- mention the errors we might have when submitting
	- how to compile and run the input text file
	
Divide into several packages

Document the reason if the UML and data Structure has been modified from milestone 1
