Data Structure Design Documentation
Player:
Descision: HashMap is used to map the cooldown to the planttypes
Reason: The PlantTypes are uniqued so they can be used as key balues for the hashmap

Descision: Helper method for Play
Reason: Seperate the input method(text or gui) from the actual method

PlantFactory
Descision: Using a PlantType enum
Reasons: Using an enum instead of storing all the information in the files allows mapping the enums to a class

Level
Decision: Used an array of ArrayLists with Interface Map.Entry
Reason: reading the information about the level from a text file into an array. The array represents the number of rows. and the arrayList has the zombies contained in each row indentified with the their turn number
