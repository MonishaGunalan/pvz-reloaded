DELIVERABLES
	TEST:
		- For next milestone please test conditions where the method should fail to test its robustness
		- Please include tests for GameMode
		- Please include tests for OffensivePlant's methods. Although its an abstract class, its methods are still used by other classes and should be tested
	MVC:
		- The controller in GameView should not be updating the view. The model should nofitify the view that it has been changed and the view should update itselt.
		
	BUGS:
		- If there are 3 or more zombies in a square, the plant image will not draw in the square
		- Game remembers plant selection choice even after navigating out of plant selection menu
	
DOCUMENTATION
	- Please include all classes or interfaces that you extended or implemented from in your class diagram. This includes ActionListener, Observer and Obserable
	JAVADOC:
		- Please make sure you fill in the discription of what each class represents to allow future users of the class to understand what it represents
	
CODING STYLE
	- You might want to consider breaking the pvz package into sub-packages
	- Make sure you author who wrote each test class
	- Please specify why you chose to use package variables over private variables in your design docuemnt for next milestone. Note: Since all classes are in the same package, a package scope variable is visible to all classes.
	VERSION CONTROL:
		- I have noticed that there is an imbalanced in work done. If the weight of the next milestone is not shared between the group members I will have to weight the marks for certain individuals.
